***KEY CHANGES***
* Rather than installing the latest version of Python, the new version will use the latest Python 3 version supported in Raspbian - as of this writing Python 3.5.3.
* Whilst this seems to be a step backwards, it is a in fact a giant step forward as we benefit from significant installation speedups made possible by the recently released  ***piwheels*** project.
* The scripts will work across the entire range of Raspberry Pis - perhaps with the exception of the early models with just 256MB of memory - I tested Pi 1, 2, 3 and ZeroW.
* The new version provides Python support for gpio, sensehat and picamera without the worries of breaking things on the system level as all Python modules will be pip installed into a virtual environment using a requirements.txt file.
* This achieves a more maintainable setup and opens up more possibilities.
* Pyhon 3, Julia and Bash kernels will be installed and configured. R, Ruby and Octave kernels are likely to follow as I find the time.
* JupyterLab will be installed and ready to use.
